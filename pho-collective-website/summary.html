        <h2>Topic & Purpose:</h2>
        <p>My website will be a modern, responsive, info website that unites my family's three sister Vietnamese pho
            restaurants under one brand and one story (Pho Anh Dao, Alameda; Pho Anh Dao, Oakland; & Pho Benny,
            Lafayette). It will showcase each restaurant's individual menus, locations, pictures, online ordering,
            "about us", etc.
            The intended audience is food-enjoyers in the Bay Area who are looking for a place to eat Vietnamese cuisine
            and need more information on our story and food. The website will aim to provide visitors with an
            easy-to-navigate experience that reflects the authenticity of our dishes.
            The website uses a warm design that highlights the comfort and authenticity of Vietnamese dining, with
            elegant, clean, balanced layouts. Its color scheme blends earthy tones with vibrant accents. </p>
