                <img src="img/enhypen.png" alt="ENHYPEN" id="group" class="image">
                K-pop is dominated by major entertainment companies like HYBE, JYP Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and
                SM
                Entertainment, each known for producing globally successful idol groups. HYBE manages BTS, ENHYPEN, and
                TXT,
                while JYP is behind groups like TWICE, Stray Kids, and ITZY. YG Entertainment is home to BLACKPINK and
                TREASURE, known for their bold visuals and hip-hop style. Each company has its own distinct training
                system
                and musical identity, shaping the artists they debut.
            </p>
            <p>
                These companies not only focus on music but also on visuals, storytelling, and social media strategy to
                market their groups internationally. Newer agencies like ADOR (under HYBE, managing NewJeans) and
                Starship
                Entertainment (home to IVE) are also gaining traction. With each debut, K-pop companies aim to create
                unique
                concepts, helping groups stand out in a highly competitive industry.

            <h2>Concerts</h2>
            <p>
                K-pop concerts are famous for their high energy, elaborate choreography, and spectacular stage
                production.
                From massive LED screens and synchronized dance formations to pyrotechnics and costume changes, K-pop
                concerts are theatrical experiences. Groups like BTS, BLACKPINK, and TWICE fill stadiums worldwide, with
                fans traveling long distances to see them live.

                Many K-pop artists also hold world tours, bringing Korean music to fans across Asia, North America,
                Europe,
                and beyond. Virtual concerts have also become more popular, especially during the pandemic, allowing
                fans
                from all over the world to tune in at once. The sense of connection between artists and their fans
                during
                these shows is a huge part of what makes K-pop concerts special.

            <h2>Fandom Culture</h2>
            <p>
                K-pop fandoms are incredibly organized, passionate, and global. Each group has an official fandom name
                and
                color—for example, BTS's ARMY, BLACKPINK's BLINKs, and Stray Kids’ STAY. These fandoms support their
                idols
                by streaming music, organizing fan events, and even crowdfunding advertisements for birthdays and
                anniversaries.

            <p>
                Fan culture also includes creating fan chants, attending fan sign events, and buying albums and merch in
                bulk to support their favorite group’s chart rankings. Social media plays a huge role, as fans use
                platforms
                like Twitter, TikTok, and Weverse to stay connected with idols and each other. K-pop fandoms have even
                been
                known to participate in charitable causes and activism, showing their collective power beyond music.
